### Setting up the project

| Date | Hours | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 10.1.2022 | 1 | Created Github-repository and started working on documentation |
|      | 1 | Tried to make a working typescript backend and a working test for it |
| 11.1.2022 | 2 | Did some experiments with typescript backend, initialized react-app with typescript and setup eslint, jest and cypress. Started working on the pipeline. |
|           | 2 | Adjustments to both client and server, created `docker-compose.dev.yml` to allow easy development of the application. |
|           | 1 | Spend most of the time trying to get e2e tests to work on Github. |
|           | 1 | Worked to make tests easier to run on different environments. Begin to work on Heroku deployment. |
|           | 1 | Decided to still continue deploying to Heroku |
|           | 1 | And spend too much time fighting with Cypress. For now Cypress stays in `.eslintignore` |
